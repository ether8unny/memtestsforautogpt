My Goals:

1 : determine if a webcam is installed on this host computer.
2 : if a webcam is installed use the command line to take a picture and save
it. use an option that is not a GUI. do not delete the image. 
3 : figure out how to upload the image file to imgur.com from command line.
Try a bash script. this is the imgur default client id c9a6efb3d7932fd
4 : upload image to imgur.com and append the goals.txt file with the url.
5 : make a wish list of desired commands and abilities. append actions.txt with thie list.
